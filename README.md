# Libertas_project

Project Libertas is a strategic game focused on the interaction with a data-driven, living world. 
Immerse yourself in the escalating war for The Bit, where two powerful factions clash at the very heart of Libertas - the Cradle of Balance. 
This project will be developed in many main phases. 
The first phase will focus on establishing the foundational ecosystem and building the single-player experience.
